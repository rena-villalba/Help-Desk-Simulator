Help Desk Simulation Lab - Active Directory & ITSM (FreshService)

Objective:
Simulate a realistic IT Help Desk environment where common Active Directory (AD) issues are resolved via tickets submitted through FreshService.

The lab focuses on handling support scenarios such as:
- Account lockout due to incorrect password attempts
- Disabled accounts
- Password reset requests
- New user provisioning (optional)

Note: This project assumes a pre-configured AD domain and domain-joined client VM.
