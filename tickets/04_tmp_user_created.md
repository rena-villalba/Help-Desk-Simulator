- Temporary accounts should always have expiration dates to minimize security risks.
- Creating a dedicated OU or group for temp users simplifies access control and cleanup.
- It's important to confirm access scope with HR or the requester to avoid over-provisioning.
- Documenting the request and the account details in FreshService ensures traceability and compliance.
- Periodic review of temporary accounts can help prevent unused accounts from remaining active beyond their intended timeframe.
